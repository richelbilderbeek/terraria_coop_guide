# terraria_coop_guide

Guide for playing Terraria coop in a fun way.

## Goal

To make Terraria fun to play cooperatively
with complete beginners.

## Principles

 * Look for a fun path, which is usually a path of low resistance.
   Or: play the game as it is intended
 * Dying often is not fun

## Steps

### World creating

Pick a world that is

- Difficulty: classic
- Size: medium
- Random

Although the journeyman mode may seem easier, 
it does not help playing the game as intended,
as a journeyman player is overpowered.
Using classic difficulty helps gradually 
growing stronger and gradually exploring the world.

### Day 1: build a safe place you can go in and out

Chop down wood by using an Axe on the bottom of trees.

Build the walls of a house around you, where the roof is as high as you can reach.
Now you are stuck in a safe place :-)

Craft a workbench and put it on the floor.
Stand in front of the workbench and craft two doors.
For each side of the house, make a three-block high hole, starting from the bottom,
and a place a door there.
Now you have a safe place you can go in and out :-)

Spend the rest of the day chopping down trees,
and killing slimes. Go to your house when the night falls.

### Night 1: build a house

When safely inside on your first night,
now is the time to make the safe place into a real official house.

- Craft torches from the gel gathered by killing slimes. Place 1 torch
- Craft a chair and place it
- Craft wooden walls and build a back wall
- Replace the dirt floor by a wooden floor

Confirm you have a suitable house, 
so that an NPC (a non-playable character, 
for example, the dude that hangs around at your starting position)
can move in.

Spend the rest of the night:

- killing zombies outside. Move back home to regenerate your health
- replace part of the wooden floor by wooden platforms and mine down

### The Wood phase

During the day:

- gather wood
- plant acorns to grow new trees
- kill slimes to build torches
- build some more houses

During the night:

- craft a complete wooden armor set: wooden helmet, woorden chestplate, wooden greaves
- craft doors for in your mines
- mine below your house:
    - mine mostly horizontally using caves that are three blocks high
    - place torches to see
    - place doors regularly to stop monsters

Do this until you have around 4 houses and a complete wooden armor set.

### The Copper phase

From here onwards, you should both feel comfortable in your Terraria world.
Sure, leaving the home base is scare, but also exciting.
Go on little missions.

And from here on, you can visit the regular Terraria guides. Enjoy!
